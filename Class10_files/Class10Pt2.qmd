*Starting from part 4 of previous class

We need some packages for todays class. These include `bio3d` and `msa`.

The `msa` package is from BioConducter. These packages focus on genomics type work and are managed by the `BiocManager` package.

Install `install.packages("BioManager")` and then `BiocManager::install("msa")` all entered in the R "brain" console.

>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

The msa package is only found on BioConductor

>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

"Grantlab/bio3d-view" is not found on BioConductor or CRAN

>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

True!

```{r}
library(bio3d)

aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

There are 214 amino acids in the sequence

Now I can search the PDB database for related sequences
```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
#hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
#attributes(b)
#head(b$hit.tbl)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

Side-note: Lets annotate these structures (in other words find out what they are, what species they are from, stuff about the experiment they were solved in etc.)

For this we can use the `pdb.annotate()`

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
#attributes(anno)
head(anno)
```

Now we can download all these structures for further analysis with `get.pdb()` function. 

```{r}
#Download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path= "pdbs", split = T, gzip = T)
```

Now we have all these related structures we can align and superimpose

```{r}
#Align related PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
pdbs
```

## Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

# Optional Further Visualization
```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
