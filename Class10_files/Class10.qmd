# 1. Introduction to RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

Downloading CSV file for data distribution

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(stats)
```
Making a function to remove the commas from the numbers

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x))
}
```

Removing the commas from the dataset

```{r} 
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```

We can use `apply()` to fix the whole table 

```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
pdbstats
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
(totals/totals["Total"]) * 100
```

84.83% are solved by X-ray and 8.33% are solved by EM.

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(pdbstats[, "Total"] / sum(pdbstats[, "Total"]) * 100, 2)
```

86.67% are protein only. 

>Q3: Skip

Here is a lovely figure of HIP-OR with the catalytic ASP residues, the MK1 compound and the all important water 308

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogens are smaller than the resolution. So, they don't show up.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

It's water molecule 308


>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document

## The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motions of a PDB structure.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

>Q7. How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

There are 198 amino acid residues. 

>Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

One of the two non-protein residues is HOH. 

>Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure?

There are 2 protein chains in this structure.
